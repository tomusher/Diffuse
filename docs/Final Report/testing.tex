\title{Developing a device-agnostic, real-time ARS/PRS system with support for
broadcasting rich interactive content}

\begin{document}
During development, each iteration began with writing requirements and a testing plan for that iteration. After it was complete, any changes to the requirements during implementation were noted and the testing plan was executed. The following contains the documentation written for each iteration, restructured to be more concise and consistent, changes from the original notes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The testing plan tables include results, this column was not completed until the end of the iteration.
\item Tests where there were no results due to requirement changes during implementation have been removed from the test tables.
\end{itemize}

\section{Iteration 1 - Presenter System}
\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{description}
\item[R1.1] Create new Plans.
\item[R1.2] Create new Motes within a Plan.
\item[R1.3] Delete Plans/Motes.
\item[R1.4] Edit Plans/Motes.
\item[R1.5] Output JSON for Motes.
\item[R1.6] Authorise presenter users with establishments own authentication system.
\item[R1.7] Ensure only presenter who created Plan can access/edit it. 
\item[R1.8] Push content to distribution server.
\end{description}

\subsection{Requirement changes during implementation}
\begin{description}
\item[R1.6] Decision was made not to use establishments own authentication system, opting to use own account system.
\item[R1.8] Decision was made to push content to Redis pub/sub server, rather than directly to distribution server.
\end{description}

\subsection{Testing}
\begin{tabular}{p{30pt} | p{25pt} | p{140pt} | p{140pt} || p{90pt}}
Test Ref. & Req. & Method of Testing & Expected Result & Result \\ \hline
T1.1 & R1.1 & Click `New plan' button, complete form, click 'create'. & New Plan available in Plan list, new Plan entry in database. & Pass \\

T1.3 & R1.3 & Click `delete' button next to Plan/Mote & Plan/Mote removed from list, entry removed from database & Pass \\
T1.4 & R1.4 & Click `edit' button next to Plan/Mote & Same form as used with create action should appear pre-populated with existing values. Saving should modify existing Plan/Mote, not create a new one & Failed, difficulties with creating form for specific Motes. Implementation delayed until Iteration 5. \\

\section{Iteration 3 - Client System}
\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{description}

\item[R3.2] Use socket.io to listen to content from distribution server.
\item[R3.3] Display content based on template fetched from server.
\item[R3.4] Navigate pushed content history.
\item[R3.5] Prevent unauthorised users from accessing plans.
\end{description}

\subsection{Requirement changes during implementation}
\begin{description}
\item[R3.1] Decision was made to not require authorisation, but a plan-specific access code. Requirement changed to: Enable users to enter plan access code to subscribe to plan.
\item[R3.4] Requirement delayed until Iteration 6 as client development overran schedule.
\item[R3.5] Due to change in R3.1, this requirement was changed to: Ensure users only receive content for the plan they are subscribed to.
\end{description}

\subsection{Testing}

\end{description}

\subsection{Requirement changes during implementation}
As features in this iteration were optional, it was considered a priority at this point to refactor code and improve the user experience. As such, the above requirements were not implemented, but the duration of the iteration was used to tidy the entire system to make it presentable.
