# Diffuse
Diffuse is the final major project for my Internet Engineering Degree at Aberstwyth University, finished in 2011.

The idea was to build an Audience Response System for mobile devices - essentially a way for one 'presenter' 
(teacher, professor, speaker) to push out 'slides' to attendees' phones or tablets. These slides are intended to be
interactive, allowing attendees to interact with them, feeding information directly back to the presenter.

Some examples of slide types implemented include:

* Multiple choices questions - as attendees answer on their devices, the presenter sees a graph of answers update 
  in real time in the presenter interface.
* Heatmap images - attendees are prompted to tap on an area of the image (highlight the error, tap where you live on
  the map, etc.), which is shown as a heatmap to the presenter.
* Association type questions which show two sets of items, one set on each side of the screen. The user is prompted
  to drag and drop between the two sides to match up 'pairs' of answers.

The system was built for extensibility, so new slide types could be implemented in code and dropped in.
